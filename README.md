# Echo

Echo is a toy programming language that is meant to be used as a teaching tool, and for academic research into the workings of programming languages.
It is inspired by the [Monkey](https://interpreterbook.com/) programming language, and is intended to be a simple, easy to learn, and fun programming language.
with a backing of .NET and C# instead of GO.

## Example

```javsscript
let variable = 10;
let another = 5;

let add = fn(x, y) {
  x + y;
};

let result = add(variable, another);
```
